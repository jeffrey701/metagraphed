// Block explorer runtime-upgrade history (#4316/3.1): the spec-version
// transition timeline, computed live off the first-party `blocks` D1 tier's
// spec_version column (migrations/0017_block_spec_version.sql) — no new
// capture, no migration, just an aggregate read. Pure + exported for unit
// tests; the Worker does the D1 read + envelope.
//
// Coverage caveat — be honest, not just "partial": spec_version was added to
// `blocks` via a nullable ALTER on 2026-06-25 (migration 0017), and the row
// load contract is INSERT OR IGNORE on the block_number primary key
// (src/blocks.mjs) — a block row written before that date, or on any RPC
// failure, has a permanently-null spec_version that can never be back-filled
// by a later poller pass. `coverage_from_block`/`coverage_from_at` report the
// earliest block that DOES carry a reading, so a caller can tell "a version
// active before this block is invisible here" instead of reading a short
// transitions list as the network's whole runtime-upgrade history.

// One row -> one transition entry. A row whose spec_version/block_number

// ascending by block_number (the SQL's ORDER BY) — the entry list preserves
// that order, so the first entry is the earliest reading this endpoint can
// see at all (coverage_from_block/coverage_from_at). `latestRow` is the
// separately-queried truly-latest block with a reading: current_spec_version
// is NOT taken from the last transitions entry, because GROUP BY collapses
// every occurrence of a spec_version into its EARLIEST block — if a version
// ever reappeared after a newer one was already observed (a runtime
// rollback), the last transitions entry would report the superseded version
// as current. current_spec_version can itself still lag/mislead if the most
// recent blocks failed to capture a reading (best-effort, see the module
// docstring) — it is the latest KNOWN reading, not a live guarantee.
